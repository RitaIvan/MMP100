         <h2><i><p style="color:deeppink">Hello, my name is Talia Duran.<br>I am attending BMCC college, this is my second year. My major is 3d/2d animation. This website has all of my recent work done for my MMP class. My work from photoshop to Adobe Illustrator. This website is to help display what I love to do, which is draw and paint. Mostly I prefer traditional art but digital is also a hobby of mine. I love listening to different genres of music while I draw in my sketchbook. This websites background on every page is a combination of everything I love. I hope you stay awhile and check out my work.</p></i></h2>
